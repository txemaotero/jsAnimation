The aim of this repo is to provide a simple html file that you can open into
your browser and then drop there a set of csv compatible files. In this csv
files, the first column indicate the frame in which the information will be
loaded. Then custom readers must be implemented to build the objects from the
information.

Due to browsers limitations files must be loaded into memory so for the first
release only small files will be supported.

Note that the main goal of this repo is to provide me some experience in web
technologies so the code will be far from being perfect.
